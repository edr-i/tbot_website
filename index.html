        <h1>In a nutshell.</h1>
        <p>
            The main goal of this project is to build a <strong>centipede-inspired robot</strong> so that we can learn
            more about this biological structure and use its advantages for further research in the future. The robot will use the same movement mechanics as the real-life centipede species. To achieve that, the robot will incorporate actuators to move within the environment, sensors to record the movements and axis positions, a controller and a 3D-printed frame.  These all work together to create a device than can be controlled from the user in specialized scenarios and display the interesting characteristics of this fascinating creature.
        </p>
        <p>That is what we're trying to do, summed up. Feel free to head over to the <a href="product.html">Product</a> page to get
            detailled infos about how we're doing it, <a href="statistics.html">Statistics</a> to see what our robot has achieved
            until now, or just keep scrolling to get a better understanding of why we're doing all this. </p>

                    <p>In November 2019 Albania was struck by a strong earthquake, powerful enough to be felt as far as
                        Italy and Serbia. It collapsed 2000 buildings, displaced 17000 people and the death toll of 51
                        made it the world's deadliest earthquake in 2019.</p>
                    <p>Albania received assistance from 29 countries around the globe. With no real infrastructure,
                        personnel and most importantly equipment to deal with such a catastrophe, the whole country
                        relied on international help. It was devastating to see thousands of families in desparate need
                        of help and the state with no opportunity to solve a problem of this degree.</p>
                    <p>Our device, although only interesting for a niche, aims to bring back in a way or another to the
                        place we were raised in. However minimal or life-changing of an impact it will have, we want to
                        feel that we contributed to our community in the way we know best: through technology. </p>

                <p>A centipede is a type of myriapod with many legs. Centipedes are predators. They hunt during the night; they are nocturnal. Some centipedes are venomous, but none can kill a person unless they are allergic. Centipedes are in the class Chilopoda, and related to millipedes, which are not poisonous. As the millipedes, they are segmented. They have between 5 and 173 segments, but only one pair of legs per segment. There may be 8,000 species in the world.</p>
                <p>What is interesting for us about this creature is their method of movement (also known as locomotion). Centipedes display a much more different body-limb coordination compared to other animals. They walk by propagating a wave of leg movement along the length of the body, so that each leg moves in strict sequence. A demo can be seen on the right. </p>
